About myself:

I encompass a can-do attitude with all endeavors I find in life. I call this the KPA plan, or better known as the “Keep Plugging Away” plan. I am a very curious individual who loves to explore new possible routes to success. Although the road is always filled with challenges, this allows me to be creative and constantly learning in an ever changing environment. Determination and persistence are my two key ingredients to continuously learning on the go and applying past learning experiences to current problem sets.
